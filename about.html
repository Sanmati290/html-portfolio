<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Sanmati U Shinganmakki. I'm a Computer Science student at KLE Technological University, Hubli. I'm a Web Developer and I enjoy coding. </p>

<p> I'm also a self trained artist and a trained vocalist. I have had my classical vocal lessons for about 12 years under my guru Vid.Varada Kulkarni. I enjoy making song covers and posting them on my instagram account. I also play the guitar. I love painting with acrylics.  </p>

<p>I aspire to be a Software Engineer and work in the IT Industry in Banglore and also persue my music career along with work. I want to be a performer and probably a professional artist for a brand or a Cafe' in about 5-7 years time.</p>
